# Inspiration
After reflecting on our struggles when learning how to drive, we took inspiration to create an application to teach new drivers the rules of the road outside of reading a handbook.

# What it does
Drive Test to Success allows users to play an interactive game that simulates driving a car under Ontario's driving rules and safety regulations.

# How we built it
We built the app using JavaFX, Java, HTML and CSS.

# Challenges we ran into
Coding moving objects.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning a brand new language in a short time frame.

# What we learned
We learned a new language, JavaFX, which taught us more about UI.

# What's next for Drive Test to Success
Adding more complex levels to the game.
